BUG REPORTS
       If  you  find a bug in fnc, you should report it.  But first, you should make sure that it really is a bug, and that it appears in
       the latest version of fnc.  The latest version is always available from https://github.com/Kelvinskell/filename-changer.git

       If you have a  fix,  you  are encouraged  to  mail  that as well! Better still, submit a pull request.
       Suggestions and `philosophical' bug reports may be mailed to kelvinskell@gmail.com or submitted as a pull request to https://github.com/Kelvinskell/filename-changer.git

       ALL bug reports should include:

       The version number of fnc
       The hardware and operating system
       The compiler used to compile
       A description of the bug behaviour
       A short script or `recipe' which exercises the bug

BUGS
      Most likely than not, this script will not source the .bash_aliases file, even though it'll create the alias 'fnc'.
      The best way to work around this is to manually source the .bash_aliases file (source ~/.bash_aliases). 
      This is especially important if you intend to call up the script at anytime by just running the alias 'fnc'.
